# Sesson 0: Object Oriented Programming and You

So you've agreed to come to this course. Lucky you! You're picking up a brand new skill in programming. The goal of this is not to learn it all - none of us know it all and you've picked a skill that is constantly being changed. The goal is instead to learn the basics of what makes up a program, how to learn a programming language, and how to apply that to make a simple program of your own.

For this course, we are going to focus on .NET and C# specifically. At the time of this course, these are industry leading technologies and are a good framework/language respectively to demonstrate what Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is all about.

## Getting started

So, we know what language and framework we are going to use. Let's get your local environment setup. Start by installing Visual Studio Community and the .NET framework. See the [readme](../README.md) for links for those applications.
